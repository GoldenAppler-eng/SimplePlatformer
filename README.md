Simple Platformer is a simple platformer(pretty self-explanatory). I started this practice as a test game for Godot and got a bit carried away with the contents. All of the code is written in C#
but I might rewrite the game in GDScript if I have time.

Please ignore the fact that all of the files were uploaded, I did not know how to use git at the time. (I have matured since then)
